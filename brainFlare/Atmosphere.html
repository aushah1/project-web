      The atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding Earth, held in place by gravity. 
      It is essential for life, providing oxygen, protecting from harmful solar radiation,
      and regulating temperature. Hereâ€™s an overview of the atmosphere's structure, functions,
      and some interesting facts.

      <b>### Layers of the Atmosphere</b>

      The atmosphere is divided into several layers based on temperature and composition:

      1. <b>Troposphere</b>: The lowest layer where weather occurs and where most of the 
      atmospheric mass is found. It extends up to about 8-15 kilometers (5-9 miles) above the
      Earth's surface.
      - <b>Weather</b>: All weather phenomena, such as rain, snow, and storms, occur in the
      troposphere.
      - <b>Airplanes</b>: Most commercial airplanes fly within the lower to middle part of the 
      troposphere.

      2. <b>Stratosphere</b>: Extends from about 15 to 50 kilometers (9 to 31 miles) above the 
      Earth's surface. It contains the ozone layer, which absorbs and scatters ultraviolet solar 
      radiation.
      - <b>Ozone Layer</b>: Protects life on Earth by absorbing most of the sun's harmful UV 
      radiation.
      - <b>Jet Streams</b>: High-altitude, fast-moving winds that influence weather patterns.

      3. <b>Mesosphere</b>: Extends from about 50 to 85 kilometers (31 to 53 miles) above the
      Earth. It is the layer where most meteors burn up upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
      - <b>Meteor Burning</b>: Meteors entering the atmosphere at high speeds ignite and 
      disintegrate in this layer.
      - <b>Temperature</b>: Temperatures decrease with altitude, making it the coldest layer.

      4. <b>Thermosphere</b>: Extends from about 85 to 600 kilometers (53 to 373 miles) above the
      Earth. It is characterized by high temperatures due to the absorption of high-energy
      radiation.
      - <b>Auroras</b>: The Northern and Southern Lights occur in this layer due to interactions 
      between solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.
      - <b>International Space Station</b>: Orbits within the thermosphere.

      5. <b>Exosphere</b>: The outermost layer, extending from about 600 kilometers (373 miles) 
      to 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) above the Earth. It gradually fades into outer space.
      - <b>Space Boundary</b>: The transition zone between Earth's atmosphere and outer space.
      - <b>Satellites</b>: Many satellites orbit within this layer.

      <b>### Functions of the Atmosphere</b>

      1. <b>Protection from Radiation</b>: The atmosphere filters harmful solar radiation, 
      including ultraviolet rays, protecting living organisms on Earth.
      2. <b>Temperature Regulation</b>: It helps maintain Earth's temperature through the 
      greenhouse effect, trapping heat and preventing extreme temperature fluctuations.
      3. <b>Oxygen Supply</b>: Provides essential oxygen for respiration in animals and humans.
      4. <b>Weather and Climate</b>: The atmosphere is responsible for weather patterns and climate.
