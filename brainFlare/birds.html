      Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by feathers, wings, and beaks.
      They exhibit a wide range of adaptations that allow them to thrive in various 
      habitats around the world. Hereâ€™s an overview of bird classification,
      interesting facts, and notable species.

      <b>### Classification of Birds</b>

      Birds can be classified into several groups based on their physical characteristics
      and behaviors. Here are some primary categories:

      1. <b>Flightless Birds</b>: Birds that have lost the ability to fly. Examples include:
      - <b>Ostrich</b>: The largest and heaviest living bird, native to Africa.
      - <b>Emu</b>: Found in Australia, known for its long legs and fast running speed.
      - <b>Penguins</b>: These birds are adapted for aquatic life and are found in
      the Southern Hemisphere.

      2. <b>Raptors (Birds of Prey)</b>: Birds known for their keen eyesight, 
      powerful talons, and hooked beaks. Examples include:
      - <b>Eagles</b>: Large birds with strong beaks and broad wingspans.
      - <b>Hawks</b>: Agile birds known for their hunting prowess.
      - <b>Falcons</b>: Fast-flying birds that use speed to catch prey.

      3. <b>Water Birds</b>: Birds adapted for aquatic habitats. Examples include:
      - <b>Ducks</b>: Waterfowl with webbed feet for swimming.
      - <b>Swans</b>: Elegant birds known for their long necks and graceful movements.
      - <b>Pelicans</b>: Large birds with distinctive pouches for catching fish.

      4. <b>Songbirds</b>: Passerines known for their melodious songs. Examples include:
      - <b>Nightingale</b>: Known for its beautiful singing voice.
      - <b>Robin</b>: Common in gardens, recognized for its red breast.
      - <b>Canaries</b>: Popular as pets, known for their vibrant plumage and singing 
      ability.

      <b>### Interesting Facts About Birds</b>

      1. <b>Hummingbird</b>: The smallest bird species, capable of hovering in mid-air and
      flying backwards. They have incredibly fast wing beats, up to 80 times per second.

      2. <b>Albatross</b>: These birds have the largest wingspan of any bird, reaching up to 
      11 feet. They are known for their ability to glide effortlessly over oceans for hours
      without flapping their wings.

      3. <b>Migratory Birds</b>: Many bird species undertake seasonal migrations covering 
      thousands of miles. The Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration, 
      traveling from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back each year.

      4. <b>Birds of Paradise</b>: Found in New Guinea and Australia, these birds are known 
      for their elaborate plumage and courtship displays. They exhibit a remarkable diversity of 
      colors and behaviors.

      5. <b>Owls</b>: Nocturnal birds of prey known for their ability to rotate their heads
      almost 360 degrees. They have specialized feathers for silent flight and exceptional hearing.

      6. <b>Peacock</b>: The male peacock displays a stunning tail of iridescent feathers, 
      which it uses to attract females during courtship displays. This display is one of the most 
      elaborate in the animal kingdom.

      7. <b>Flight Formation</b>: Some bird species, like geese, fly in V-shaped formations during 
      migration. This formation helps reduce wind resistance and allows birds to conserve energy 
      during long flights.

      8. <b>Bird Communication</b>: Birds use a variety of vocalizations, calls, and songs to 
      communicate with mates, warn of predators, and establish territories. Some species, 
      like parrots, can mimic human speech.

      9. <b>Avian Intelligence</b>: Birds such as crows, ravens, and parrots are known for their
      problem-solving abilities and tool use. They demonstrate complex social behaviors and cognitive 
      skills comparable to primates.

      Birds are not only admired for their beauty and diversity but also play crucial ecological
      roles, including pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Their adaptations for flight 
      and diverse habitats make them one of the most fascinating groups of animals on Earth.
