    Volcanoes are geological formations that occur when magma from beneath the Earth's 
    crust escapes to the surface, often resulting in explosive eruptions. These natural 
    phenomena are fascinating and can be both destructive and constructive. Here's an 
    overview of how volcanoes form, types of volcanoes, and some interesting facts about
    them.

    <b>Formation of Volcanoes</b>

    Volcanoes form at tectonic plate boundaries, where plates are either diverging 
    (moving apart), converging (coming together), or at hotspots. The primary types of 
    volcanic activity include:

    1. <b>Divergent Boundaries</b>: At mid-ocean ridges, tectonic plates move apart, allowing 
    magma to rise and create new crust. Iceland is a prime example of volcanic activity at 
    a divergent boundary.
    
    2. <b>Convergent Boundaries</b>: Where an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continental 
    plate, magma forms and rises to create volcanoes. The Pacific Ring of Fire is known for
    its numerous convergent boundary volcanoes.

    3. <b>Hotspots</b>: These are volcanic regions thought to be fed by underlying mantle that 
    is anomalously hot compared to the surrounding mantle. The Hawaiian Islands are an example 
    of hotspot volcanism.

    <b>Types of Volcanoes</b>

    Volcanoes can be classified into several types based on their shape, eruption style, and 
    lava composition:

    1. <b>Shield Volcanoes</b>: These have gentle slopes and are primarily built up by the flow
    of low-viscosity basaltic lava. Mauna Loa in Hawaii is a classic example.
    
    2. <b>Stratovolcanoes (Composite Volcanoes)</b>: These volcanoes are characterized by steep 
    profiles and periodic, explosive eruptions. Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount St. Helens in 
    the USA are stratovolcanoes.
    
    3. <b>Cinder Cone Volcanoes</b>: These are the smallest type of volcano, with steep slopes 
    built from volcanic debris and ash. Parícutin in Mexico is a well-known cinder cone.

    4. <b>Lava Domes</b> Formed by viscous lava that piles up near the vent, these domes can 
    create highly explosive eruptions. Mount St. Helens has a prominent lava dome.

    <b> Interesting Facts About Volcanoes</b>

    1. <b>Most Active Volcano</b>: Kilauea in Hawaii is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth,
    with nearly continuous eruptions since 1983.

    2. <b>Largest Volcano</b>: Mauna Loa in Hawaii is the world's largest volcano in terms of
    volume and area covered. It rises 13,681 feet above sea level and spans 5,271 square miles.

    3. <b>Supervolcanoes</b>: Yellowstone in the USA is a supervolcano, which means it has had an
    eruption of magnitude 8 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). Its eruptions can be thousands 
    of times more powerful than typical volcanic eruptions.

    4. <b>Volcanoes on Other Planets</b>: Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons,
    which stands about 13.6 miles high—nearly three times the height of Mount Everest.

    5. <b>Underwater Volcanoes</b>: More than 80% of volcanic eruptions occur underwater. These 
    underwater volcanoes can create new landforms and significantly affect oceanic ecosystems.

    6. <b>Volcanic Lightning</b>: Sometimes, volcanic eruptions can produce lightning within the ash 
    cloud. This phenomenon is caused by the friction between particles in the volcanic plume.

    7. <b>Volcanic Ash and Climate</b>: Large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of ash
    and sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, leading to temporary cooling of the Earth's climate. 
    The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a global temperature drop of about 0.5°C (0.9°F).

    Volcanoes are powerful reminders of the dynamic nature of our planet. Their eruptions can shape 
    landscapes, create new land, and even influence global climate patterns. Despite their potential 
    for destruction, volcanoes also provide fertile soil for agriculture and geothermal energy, 
    highlighting their dual role in both creation and destruction.
